# JobApp Repository

This repository contains two different architectures of the **JobApp** project: 

1. **JobApp Monolith**: A single-application architecture.
2. **JobApp Microservices**: A modularized architecture built with a microservices approach.

Both submodules are separate Git repositories included as submodules in this main repository.
